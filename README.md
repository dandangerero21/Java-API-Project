#Java Weather API App
A desktop-based weather forecasting application built using Java Swing, designed to fetch and display real-time weather data via a third-party REST API. This project demonstrates API integration, GUI development, and JSON data handling in a Java environment.

#Key Features:
Real-time Weather Data: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions fetched from a public weather API.

JSON Parsing: Parses API responses efficiently using JSON libraries such as json-simple or Gson.

Java Swing Interface: Built with Java Swing for a functional and user-friendly graphical interface.

Dynamic Background Rendering: Changes background images based on the current weather condition.

External Configuration: API keys and sensitive settings are stored securely in an external properties file, excluded from version control via .gitignore.
